Overall, the changes in this pull request include enhancements to the Button Counter example. Heres a brief overview of the updates:

- The page title was modified to Button Counter with Banner.
- A new CSS class named "banner" was added to create a fixed banner at the top of the page.
- The body element received a margin of 0 and a background color of #f4f4f9.
- The main content section was adjusted to have a top margin of 60px and centered text alignment.
- Buttons now have a stylish look with rounded corners, a hover effect, and a vibrant background color (#008CBA).
- The hover effect was updated to have a darker shade of blue (#005f6b).

These changes improve the visual appeal and user experience of the Button Counter example. Great work on the enhancements!
